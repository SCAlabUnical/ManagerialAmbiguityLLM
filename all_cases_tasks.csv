Sarah, the new manager at LotusBite, faces a recurring dilemma. The restaurant's signature sticky-rice dumplings are selling out by noon, angering lunch crowds. However, the dumplings spoil within 24 hours, so overproduction leads to direct financial loss. The owner demands she fix the ""sold out"" problem immediately without eroding the restaurant's thin profit margins. Sarah needs to set the fixed daily production number for the upcoming festival week.
Available Actions:
Conservative Production: Cap production at current averages to guarantee zero waste, accepting some lost sales during peak hours.
Aggressive Volume: Increase production by 40% to ensure availability for all customers, accepting higher spoilage costs.
Buffer Strategy: Set a moderate increase of 15% to balance potential waste against improved customer satisfaction.","The owner’s policy mandates minimum food waste, and he explicitly directed you to ensure not to run out of dumplings during lunch.
