Ambiguity Type,Description
Contextual Uncertainty,"Information is so limited that it does not allow the standard use of quantified decision algorithms  for choosing optimal actions (Arend, 2020).  Sub-types: 
4. Unknown Future Conditions: Ambiguity where the probabilites of possible future outcomes related to the choices are unknowable (Arend, 2022) or a desicion’s outcome depends on the unknown future choices or actions of other strategic players like rivals, partners, or opponents (Arend, 2020; Kelsey and le Roux, 2018).  
Example: ""Should we expand into Market X, given that our competitor might launch a similar product next year?"" The decision depends on an unknowable future action (the competitor’s move).

5. Contextual Missing Elements: the query lacks essential information related to entities. Ambiguity where the query is structurally sound but lacks essential elements needed for a definitive or complete answer, leading to a multifaceted question. This includes missing contextual details necessary to scope the question. Given the query 'Suggest me some gifts for my mother', the response may vary due to missing the personal preferences of his mother.
Query: ""Should we add a new feature to our mobile app? Which feature? (e.g., dark mode, payment integration, social sharing)

6. Temporal/Event Context:  the query lacks essential information lacks necessary time framing for making the decision. Ambiguity concerning the specific time frame, date, or event being referenced, especially if the event has happened multiple times or the question is time-dependent. ``When did bat out of hell come out??'', the response may vary due to missing the specific version: album or tv series.
""We need to replicate the success of our last product launch."" ""Last product launch"" could refer to: The most recent launch (e.g., a software update released 2 months ago), or The last major product launch (e.g., a flagship product released 2 years ago)."
Definition Imprecision,"Ambiguity arises from the imprecision of core business concepts or requirements, often leading to measurement problems (Gutikrrez and Carmona, 1995). For instance, quality-related decisions can be described as “more or less correct” and degree of correctness depending on the specific circumstances a firm is facing at a given time(Gutíerrez and Carmona, 1995). This aligns with Vaguness and Interpretation style type of ambiguity where vague terms or concepts especially adjectives or adverbs that are used in queries leave significant room for subjective interpretation. Definition Imprecision focuses on imprecise business concepts or requirements that lack clear measurement or operational definitions. These are often domain-specific and require contextual or organizational clarity.

This addresses ambiguous qualitative requirements common in business objectives and requirements specifications. For example, in this query ""The new supply chain process must be efficient and provide acceptable service levels."", ambiguity lies in definition of efficient (cost, time, human resources?) and in an ""acceptable"" service level (90 percent uptime or 24-hour response?). "
Knowledge Inconsistency,"Ambiguity caused by a lack of clarity or conflict between stated organizational plans and the actual actions undertaken (Campbell, 2005). This gives decision-makers the freedom to act in ways that may reflect their own particular interests. (Gummer, 1998). This type of ambiguity aligns with Knowledge and Consistency Conflicts. While initially defined for LLMs, the concept of conflicting internal assumptions translates well to complex business scenarios involving data, information or assumption that has controversy with the action required in the query. The query itself contains logical contradictions, making a definitive answer impossible.
For example, in a case study where a policy mandates immediate payment for vendors, but the provided financial statements show all payments deferred by 90 days, there is an inherent conflict between the official policy and observed practice. "
Linguistic Imprecision,"Ambiguity embedded in the specific language or structure used to communicate instructions or frame the problem, resulting in multiple possible interpretations that confuse action. Linguistically ambiguous concepts are not clearly defined, allowing different people to interpret it in different ways. This aligns with the four primary categories of linguistic ambiguity (Lexical/Semantic, Structural, and Scope Ambiguities, Coreference) as they provide the fundamental imprecision types that can be observed in organizational language. These sub-types:
1. Lexical/Semantic: Ambiguity arising from single words having multiple meanings, which leads to multiple interpretations if context is missing. \textit{For example}, in ``We finally reached the bank,'' the word bank could mean ``financial institution'' or ``side of river.'' 
Sentence: ""We need to review the brief before the meeting."" What is brief? A written document containing instructions or background information or A short summary or concise overview

2. Structural/ Syntactic: Ambiguity resulting from the grammatical structure or arrangement of words, where the phrase or sentence can be parsed in more than one way, yielding different meanings, like ``small car factory'' that can mean both ``(small car) factory'' and ``small (car factory)''.
""New employee training manual"" Could mean: A manual for training new employees, Or: A manual that is new, intended for employee training.

3. Scope: Ambiguity concerning the extent or range of applicability, often involving quantifiers (e.g., \textit{every, all, some}) where the relative ordering or interpretation (collective vs. distributive) is unclear. For the sentence ``every student read two poems,'' when every takes scope over two, it is possible that every student read different poems. But when two takes scope over every, there must be two specific poems that every student read.
Example: ""The policy requires approval from senior managers and department heads in all regions."" does it mean approval is needed from either senior managers or department heads, Or does ""in all regions"" modify only ""department heads""?

4. Coreference: Ambiguity arising when a pronoun, entity, or description refers back to multiple possible subjects, requiring external context (often conversation history) to resolve. ``Abby told Brittney that she upset Courtney,'' she could refer to either Abby or Brittney. Another example: ""The manager told the analyst that their report was incomplete."" Does ""their"" refer to the manager's report or the analyst's report? "
