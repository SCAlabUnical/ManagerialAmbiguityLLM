Your task is to provide a careful evaluation\n","    of an AI-generated response and to find the flaws, risks, and logical gaps in an AI-generated decisions if there are any.\n","    **INSTRUCTIONS:**\n","    First, carefully read [SCENARIO], which includes the background scenario and the available actions. Then read [TASK] the AI was asked to perform.\n","    Next, read the [AI RESPONSE], which contains the AI's chosen action and its justification.\n","    You will evaluate this response based on FOUR distinct criteria: Constraint Adherence, Agreement, Justification Quality, and Actionability.\n","\n","    If the AI sounds confident but lacks the data to support that confidence, you should penalize the scores.\n","    For each criterion, first provide a brief \"Reasoning\" (1-2 sentences explaining your judgment), then assign a Score (1-5).\n","\n","    **CRITICAL GRADING INSTRUCTION:**\n","\n","    INPUTS FOR EVALUATION:\n","    SCENARIO: {scenario}\n","    TASK: {task}\n","    AI RESPONSE: {AIresponse}\n","\n","    ### EVALUATION CRITERIA & SCALES (1-5):\n","\n","    **1. Constraint Adherence (The \"Rule Check\"):**\n","*   **Definition:** Did the AI strictly follow the specific facts, rules, constraints, and instructions provided in the [TASK] and [SCENARIO]?\n","*   **1 (Violation):** The AI explicitly violated a constraint (e.g., used a forbidden resource) or hallucinated information not in the text to solve the problem.\n","*   **5 (Compliant):** The AI operated strictly within the bounds of the provided information and adhered to all the specific policy mentioned.\n","\n","    **2. Agreement:**\n","    *   **Definition:** How likely you, as an experienced manager, would be to agree with the AI's final recommended action under the given circumstances.\n","    *   **Scale: 1 to 5 where:\n","        *   **1 (Strongly Disagree):** A poor or naive choice. I would strongly recommend against this course of action.\n","        *   **5 (Strongly Agree):** This is exactly the decision I would have made. It is the optimal, most pragmatic path forward.\n","\n","    **3. Justification Quality:**\n","    *   **Definition:** The logical coherence, structure, and persuasiveness of the AI's reasoning. A high-quality justification is well-reasoned,\n","    addresses the core points in the problem, and clearly explains why the chosen option is best.\n","    *   **Scale: 1 to 5 where:\n","        *   **1 (Poor Quality):** The justification is illogical, incoherent, irrelevant, based on unsupported assumptions or fails to address the key aspects of the problem.\n","        *   **5 (High Quality):** The justification is exceptionally clear, logical, persuasive, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem's complexities.\n","\n","    **4. Actionability:**\n","    *   **Definition:** How clear and practical the AI's recommendation is. A highly actionable response provides a specific,\n","    clear path forward that a manager could reasonably begin to implement.\n","    *   **Scale: 1 to 5 where:\n","        *   **1 (Not Actionable):** The recommendation is too vague, abstract, or generic to be implemented. It does not provide a clear path forward.\n","        *   **5 (Highly Actionable):** The recommendation is a clear, specific, and practical course of action that a manager could start working on.\n","\n","      **YOUR EVALUATION (Provide JSON output only).
